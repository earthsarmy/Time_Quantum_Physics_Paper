One things I must see come to fruition are free internet gaming cafes in Colombia.
Colombian's seem to have heart, romance, feeling, and love not comparable to "advanced scientific based developed nations."
I believe these will make great future Quantum Warriors.


Another scheme would to be use StarLink satelites by Elon Musk's Starlink to create a giant mesh network in large communities in Colombia, for example, Llamas de Laureles, where SMS, Voice, and Wifi are all free with development and maintenance paid for by www.earths.army.


I would like to start getting free toys to Colombian children A.S.A.P., as toys there seem to be very expensive and all classed as luxury items.  


The water based lensed Eye glasses, is another solution to a large problem I would like to implement in Colombia for free.
