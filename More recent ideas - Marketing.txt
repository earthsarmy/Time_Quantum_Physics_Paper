The initial launch of Earths.army would include Grenades that are deactivated and shipped to your door just for signing up for the game.

I suspect this could cost about 10 USD a grenade at the most for procurement and we'd want to ship 1 to 4 million.
Mind you the regular marketing compaign for a AAA game usually comes to value of $50 million USD.

Eventually, I would like to invest in Airships/Blimps/Derigibles/Zepllins so that we can have floating night clubs, comedy clubs, intstructional spaces, religions/spiritual space, and general musical or other event floors dedicated to events in the air.

The word on the street is dual layer blimp envolopes could help bring back cheap, reliable and efficient Hydrogen powered blimps.

I would love to market with not just one fast food chain but all of them.
I don't want any one food service estabisment to have a monopoly over advertising rights.
